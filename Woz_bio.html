    Steve Wozniak is an American computer scientist best known as one of the founders of Apple
     and the inventor of the Apple II computer.
Who Is Steve Wozniak
Steve Wozniak is an American computer scientist, inventor and programmer. In partnership with his friend 
Steve Jobs, Wozniak invented the Apple I computer. The pair founded Apple Computers in 1976 with
 Ronald Wayne, releasing some of the first personal computers on the market. Wozniak also personally
  developed the next model, Apple II, which established Apple as a major player in microcomputing.

Early Life and Education
Stephen Gary Wozniak, born on August 11, 1950, in San Jose, California.
 Wozniak was the son of an engineer at Lockheed Martin and was fascinated by 
 electronics at an early age. Although he was never a star student in the traditional
  sense, Wozniak had an aptitude for building working electronics from scratch.

During his brief stint at the University of California at Berkeley, Wozniak met Steve Jobs,
 who was still in high school, through a mutual friend. The two later paired up to form Apple Computer
  on April 1, 1976, prompting Wozniak to quit his job at Hewlett-Packard.

Beginning of Apple Computer
Working out of a family home, he and Jobs attempted to produce a user-friendly alternative to the 
computers that were being introduced by International Business Machines at that time. Wozniak worked 
on the invention of products, and Jobs was responsible for marketing.


Not long after Apple was founded, Wozniak created the Apple I, a design built largely in Jobs' bedroom 
and garage. With Wozniak's knowledge of electronics and Jobs' marketing skills, the two were well-suited
 to do business together. Wozniak went on to conceive the Apple II as part of the company's personal-computer 
 series, and by 1983, Apple had a stock value of $985 million.

Wozniak ended his employment with Apple in 1985.

Later Career
In February 1981, Wozniak was injured when the private plane he was piloting crashed while taking off 
from the Santa Cruz Sky Park. His painstaking recovery lasted two years, as he suffered from a variety of injuries and amnesia.
