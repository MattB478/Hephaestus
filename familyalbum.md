I love to cook, most of my best meals are Italian type dishes, I also like to kayak i would like to do a overnighter at some point. I'm an obsessive sports fan mostly football and hockey, I never miss a Notre Dame football game. Lately F1 has jumped on my raidar though none of the drivers have gain my folloing yet. I have two cats Meatball and Bo, both were found as straies. Meatball was caught and was going to be a snip and release but ended up being a great cat and Bo was found as a kitten at the corner of Little rd and St rd 54.
