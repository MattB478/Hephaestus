// Exercise 


//Create a program that contains the following. Use values of your choosing that satisfy the conditions given.

// a). Alpha is a number that is > Beta. Beta is a number < Charlie. Charlie is a string. In the program evaluate if
// Alpha and Beta have equal values, then determine if Beta and Charlie are equal values and are the same type. If
// Alpha is not less that Beta, log a message. If Beta and Charlie are of the same value and type, log a message.

var alpha = 5
var beta = 4
var charlie = 'charlie'

console.log(alpha > beta)  // returns true

if (alpha < beta) {
  console.log("")
}

// hint:  == and === are comparison operators


// b). Add a variable called Delta which is an object. Delta has 3 properties. Customers(number), id(string),
// landed(boolean).

var delta = { customer: 3, id: 'user4722', landed: true }

// In the program check if the number of customers is > Beta AND that delta's id is not equal to Charlie.


// c). On a sheet or paper or digitally, draw a illustation of how following is allocated in memory
